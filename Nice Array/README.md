## Nice Array

https://www.codewars.com/kata/nice-array/train/javascript

Given an array of digits, test whether each number N in the array ALSO has either N+1 or N-1 (eg, if the array has 3, is there also 2 or 4?). If every digit in the array has its "neighbor", return true, otherwise, return false.
