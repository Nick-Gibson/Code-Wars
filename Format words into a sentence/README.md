Given an array of strings that are individual words, return the array as a single string where each word is separated by a comma, EXCEPT the last two words, which will be combined by the word "and" only - no oxford comma, boo! As well, empty indexes should be skipped over. E.g., array ['lions', 'tigers', 'bears'] or ['lions', 'tigers', '', 'bears'] would both return "lions, tigers and bears".
